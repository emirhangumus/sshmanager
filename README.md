## Requirements

- **Go 1.19+**
- **sshpass**
- **OpenSSH client**

Install requirements on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-client sshpass
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emirhangumus/sshmanager.git
cd sshmanager
```

### 2. Build the Binary

```bash
make build
```

### 3. (Optional) Install to `~/.local/bin`

```bash
make install
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
sshmanager
```

## Usage

### Run the App

```bash
sshmanager
```

You'll see a menu with the following options:

* **Add SSH Connection**: Enter host, username, and password (encrypted and saved).
* **Connect to SSH**: Choose a saved connection to connect instantly.
* **Edit SSH Connection**: Modify existing connection details.
* **Remove SSH Connection**: Delete specific connections safely.

### Flags

* `-clean` ‚Äì Remove all saved SSH connections:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -clean
  ```

* `-version` ‚Äì Show the current version of SSH Manager:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -version
  ```

* `-help` ‚Äì Show help information:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -help
  ```
  
* `-set` ‚Äì Set a SSHManager config:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -set <key> <value>
  ```

* `-complete` ‚Äì Show complete list of hosts for tab completion:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -complete [prefix]
  ```

* `-completion` ‚Äì Generate shell completion scripts:

  ```bash
  sshmanager -completion bash
  sshmanager -completion zsh
  ```

### Direct Connection with Aliases

You can connect directly to a saved connection using its alias:

```bash
sshmanager myserver
```

This will immediately connect to the SSH server associated with the `myserver` alias without showing the menu.
